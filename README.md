## 📘 Understanding Arbitrage Betting

### What Is Arbitrage Betting?

Arbitrage betting (or “arbing”) involves placing bets on **all possible outcomes** of an event with **different bookmakers** to lock in a profit regardless of the result. It exploits inconsistencies in odds between platforms.

### The Mathematics Behind It

Bookmakers set odds based on implied probabilities. For instance:

* Sportsbet offers **2.00** on the Knicks → 50% implied probability
* Sportsbet offers **1.85** on the Magic → 54.05% implied probability
* Combined total: **104.05%**, ensuring the bookmaker’s margin.

An arbitrage occurs when the **combined probability** is **below 100%**.
If another bookmaker offers **2.10** for the Magic, the combined probability becomes:

```
1/2.00 + 1/2.10 = 0.9762 → 97.62%
```

That implies a **2.38% ROI** opportunity.

#### Bet Sizing Example

To guarantee equal profit, distribute your $100 stake proportionally:

* Expected return: $102.38
* Bet on Knicks: 102.38 / 2.00 = **$51.19**
* Bet on Magic: 102.38 / 2.10 = **$48.75**

Result: A **guaranteed profit** regardless of outcome.

## 🔐 Secure Email Credentials with `.env`

### Setting Up

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=recipient@example.com
```

> ⚠️ Use **app-specific passwords** (with 2FA enabled) instead of your main account password.

Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` to protect credentials.

### Accessing in Code

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
email = os.getenv('EMAIL_ADDRESS')
password = os.getenv('EMAIL_PASSWORD')
recipient = os.getenv('RECIPIENT_EMAIL')
```

This setup is automatically handled in `src/email_alert.py`.
